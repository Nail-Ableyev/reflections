What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

You can start tracking changes after creating by starting saving meta data. If you don't do it, it will be just a folder with no ability to track changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is like a buffering zone which allows you to put the files that are according to your logic should go together. It also prevents making mistakes and saving wrong files.
So staging area is like a baking form and repository is an oven. Commits are cookies then))
